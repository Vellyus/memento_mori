# memento_mori
You type in your birthdate, the script now knows how many days you have lived so far.
Then it subtracts that from the average lifespan in Hungary.
As a result you get how many days you have left if you will have an average lifespan.
Then the program starts a countdown from that. (as if your last day would end at midnight)
You also have to type in your gender at the beginning, because females usually live longer.
